# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Objective
This task focuses on understanding data through statistical summaries and visual patterns. By performing EDA, I identified trends and relationships between different variables in the dataset.

## Key Insights & Steps
* **Statistical Summary**: Generated mean, median, and standard deviation to understand the central tendency and spread of the data[cite: 52].
* **Univariate Analysis**: Created histograms and boxplots to visualize the distribution of age and identify skewness[cite: 52].
* **Bivariate Analysis**: Developed a correlation heatmap to find relationships between survival rates, class, and fare[cite: 53].
* **Pattern Recognition**: Used pairplots to observe how different groups (e.g., gender or class) interacted with the survival outcome[cite: 53, 54].

## Tools Used
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
